\chapter{The Menthal Speed Layer}
\label{chap:menthal_backend_architecture}

This chapter servers as a delimiter between two global parts of our work.
The first part, that contains the previous chapters, is an observation part.
It presents the current problem of the Menthal project and the solutions offered by the world of the Big Data technologies.
It describes how global companies like Google or Facebook handle Big Data, what software tools and concepts are available in this sphere. 
Starting from this chapter only the information about our own project is presented.
This chapter includes functional and non-functional requirements to our system, its design, aspects of implementation and observation of several use cases.
