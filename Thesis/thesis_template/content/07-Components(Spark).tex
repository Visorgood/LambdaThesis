\subsubsection{Data model}

Initializing Spark
Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) (from a file, parallelizing a Scala collection, transforming an existing RDD, changing the persistence of an existing RDD)
parallel operations (reduce, collect, foreach)
Shared Variables (Broadcast variables, Accumulators)
Deploying to a Cluster

\subsubsection{Streaming model}

StreamingContext
Discretized Streams (DStreams)
Input DStreams
Transformations on DStreams
Output Operations on DStreams
Caching / Persistence, Checkpointing, Deploying Applications, Monitoring Applications ???
Performance Tuning ???
Fault-tolerance Properties ???
