Aggregations

In our project we use two types of aggregations: user-based and application-based.
Figure~\ref{fig:user_based_aggregations} represents the table of user-based aggregations.
Each of these aggregations is calculated with different granularities: hourly, daily, weekly and monthly.

\end{figure}

The aggregations presented in the table are made for each user separately.
However, all these aggregations except SCREEN\_LOCK are also implemented as a sum and averadge for all users.
