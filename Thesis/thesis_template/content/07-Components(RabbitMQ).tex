\subsection{RabbitMQ [VI]}

RabbitMQ is a queue messaging server \cite{RabbitMQ, AlvaroWilliams2012}.
It provides a robust, efficient and scalable message broker, that serves as an intermediate layer between publishing and subscribed clients.
RabbitMQ has a simple data model, that nevertheless offers a flexibility in the structure of data flows.
It gives an opportunity to adjust a tradeoff between throughput and reliability.
RabbitMQ fully applies Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
