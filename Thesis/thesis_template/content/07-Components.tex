\section{Storage Systems}

There are nowdays many different storage systems for big data management.
They have different data models and, hence, different applications.
Often they store data in a key-value manner.
In this section we consider three systems, that are relevant for our work.
HDFS is a distributed filesystem, that keeps data essentially in a tree structure in files.
Redis is a very simple in-memory key-value store.
Cassandra is a more sophisticated column-style fully distributed data storage.

\section{Real-time Data Processing Systems}

Efficient processing of big volumes of data is a crucial point for any big data system.
It must be easy to model, develop and maintain.
This section describes two data processing frameworks - \textit{Storm} and \textit{Spark}.
They have different computational models, but allow to execute the same computations.
The difference between them is that Storm is a truly real-time processing system, whereas Spark works essentially with batches, and has a streaming extension on top of batch computations.
