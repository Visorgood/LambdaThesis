\chapter{Components}
\label{chap:components}

In this chapter we describe different frameworks and technologies, that we use (or could use as alternatives) in our system.
To build the complete Speed layer, we need several components.
First of all, message queue server receives messages from the outer sources, and feed them to the processing system.
Data processing system is the core of the system, and it stores results of computations in the data storage system.
Data storage system reliably keeps data in a distributed fashion. 

\section{Message Queueing}

Message queue servers are the important part of any data system.
They fill the gap between data sources and processing components or storage systems.
There are many message queue servers, here two of them - Kafka and RabbitMQ.
Additionally in this section we mention two serialization frameworks.
They tie different components of a complex system, written in different languages, together.

\section{Real-time Data Processing Systems}

Efficient processing of big volumes of data is a crucial point for any big data system.
It must be easy to model, develop and maintain.
This section describes two data processing frameworks - \textit{Storm} and \textit{Spark}.
They have different computational models, but allow execution of the same computations.
The difference between them is that Storm is a truly real-time processing system, whereas Spark works essentially with batches, and has a streaming extension on top of batch computations.

\section{Storage Systems}

There are nowadays many different storage systems for big data management.
They have different data models and, hence, different applications.
Often they store data in a key-value manner.
In this section we consider three systems that are relevant for our work.
HDFS is a distributed file system that keeps data essentially in a tree structure in files.
Redis is a very simple in-memory key-value store.
Cassandra is more sophisticated column-style fully distributed data storage.

\section{Configuraion Management}

As long as we use many software elements in the system, it is necessary to manage a lot of configuration data.
ZooKeeper solves this task.
