\chapter{Real time processing in the Big Data context [VI]}
\label{chap:real_time_processing}

Real time processing is today a significant part of any real information system.
It comprises data parsing, normalization, application of stream algorithms and their combinations.
The speed layer of the Lambda architecture realizes real time processing.

Web-companies encounter nowdays necessity to process intense data streams in the real-time fashion.
These streams produce often vast amount of data in a short period of time.
There are plenty of examples: Google's Zeitgeist system that tracks trends in search queries (some more examples\ldots)

There are many algorithms for processing data streams.
They divide to categories depending on what type of query do they answer.
A few query types are: ``has an item already been observed?'', ``how many times has an item been observed?'', ``what is the number of unique items among observed?'', etc.

The speed layer of the Lambda architecture is a place where data streams and stream processing algorithms meet.
It handles coming data in incremental fashion and continuously builds views, that present then useful data for query answering.
It allows to combine different stream processing algorithms, aggregations and indexing.
