\authorsection{Serving layer}{VI}

Serving layer is a place where the batch layer stores batch views.
When batch layer computes batch views, it loads them into the serving layer.
Then serving layer indexes them for a fast access.
Serving layer is represented by a specific distibuted database. 
It can be swaped by new data, but it does not have ability to make random
writes.
That simplifies things extremely, because opportunity to make random writes
brings most of complexity in databases.
One example of database that can be used for serving layer is ElephantDB.
