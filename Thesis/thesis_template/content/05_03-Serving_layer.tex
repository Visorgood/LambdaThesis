\section{Serving layer}

Serving layer holds batch views.
When batch layer computes batch views, it loads them into the serving layer.
Then serving layer indexes them for a fast access.
It uses specific distibuted database to store batch views.
Such databases allow to swap the whole dataset with new data, but they does not give ability to make random writes.
That simplifies things extremely, because opportunity to make random writes brings the most of complexity in databases.
One example of database that can be used in the serving layer is ElephantDB.
